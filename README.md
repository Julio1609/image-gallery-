About

This project is a basic image gallery: a web page that displays multiple images in a gallery layout. It includes minimal styling (CSS), a script (JavaScript) for any interactive behaviour (if included), and images stored locally.

Features
	•	Grid layout of images
	•	Responsive/somehow styled with CSS
	•	Possible light interactivity (hover effects, click to enlarge, etc.) — depending on what script.js implements

Getting Started

To run this project locally:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Julio1609/image-gallery-.git


	2.	Navigate into the directory:

cd image-gallery-


	3.	Open index.html in your browser (you can just double-click or use a web server, if preferred).

Usage
	•	View images arranged in a gallery
	•	Clicking on images (if implemented) to enlarge or see detail
	•	Styles from style.css control layout / appearance
	•	Behavior from script.js (e.g., lightbox, modal, filtering, etc.)

Future Improvements

Here are some ideas you might consider:
	•	Add modal/lightbox effect when clicking an image
	•	Lazy-loading for images to improve performance
	•	Responsive layout that adapts to mobile / different screen sizes
	•	Filtering or categorisation of images
	•	Adding transitions or animations
